# NoteTote

NoteTote is a platform where high school students can easily upload and share their notes across subjects and discover relevant study materials through AI-powered recommendations to help them ace their exams.

We provide a centralized hub of student-led notes, which allows students to spend less time creating their own notes from scratch and more time building on existing knowledge.
